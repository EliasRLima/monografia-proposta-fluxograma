Teaching programming logic to people who have never coded is a challenge that has existed since the beginning of computing. The Information Systems course at IFMA-MC is no different, and the teaching methodology based on Portugol coding still faces difficulties in overcoming this challenge and ensuring an efficient teaching process for students who have never coded, so that they can advance in the programming teaching process. It is precisely at this point that this work comes in and aims to demonstrate the use of visual programming to overcome the difficulty of coding for the first time, where incoming students can learn logic first and then move on to coding. To do this, I will present a teaching method based on flowcharts and will use the Mapler Portugol Interpreter, a development environment designed specifically for teaching programming logic through the Portugol pseudolanguage, and which includes among its features the development of flowcharts to solve algorithms.
